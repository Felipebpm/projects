Welcome to projects!

My most recent work is in CS 106B written in C++. 
My earliest work is in CS50 written in C and Python.
My best work in Python is located in 6002x. You might like to look at pset2 for
a simulation of a robot vacuum cleaning a room, or pset3 which model the 
population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.
