Oh dear scientist, you’ve gone too far
Defying dogmas of church you are
You’re in the wrong century
Maybe in the wrong age
And to not die you need to deny
The ideas of your book, page by page

Oh dear scientist, you’ve gone too far
Now you shall be punished for the genius you are
What a great deal! I can’t even imagine how you feel.
How dare they! Pilfer your ideas and throw them away?
But I agree with you, before death I would just follow the sway.

And a life in the somber they’ve chosen for you
And with their plunder, they’ve burned all through


Oh dear scientist, you’ve gone too far
But I shall thank you for the genius you are!
You haven’t seen it, but your ideas were exposed!
What an amazing new vision of the world you proposed.
Brought from the dull, you’re now renowned!
But in what an obnoxious manner you were found!
Now as a genius, you are crowned!
And your ideas flow, with no bound.
